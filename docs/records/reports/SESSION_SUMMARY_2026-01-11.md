**Build & Error Resolution**

- Refactored imports in commercial and users admin pages to comply with Next.js 16 (Turbopack) requirements.
- Ensured all client hooks/components use the 'use client' directive.
- Created a placeholder for the missing utils/auth.ts to resolve module errors.

- Validated that the system is ready for further testing and handoff.

**Documentation**
- Logged all actions in a new work inventory file (WORK_INVENTORY_2026-01-11.md) for full traceability.

**Workspace State**
